# Traffic Junction Queue Simulator

## Project Description
This project simulates a four-road traffic junction using Queue and Priority Queue data structures.

The simulation is visualized using SDL2.

## Features Implemented
- Four roads(A, B, C, D)
- Each road has three lanes(AL1, AL2, AL3)
- AL2 is treated as a priority lane
- If priority lane vehicles > 10, that road is served first
- Queue used for vehicle management
- Priority logic used for tarffic light control
- File-based communication between generator and simulator
- SDL2 based visualization
- Traffic light states(RED / GREEN)
